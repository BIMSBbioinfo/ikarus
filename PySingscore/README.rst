**A Python implementation of Foroutan et al (doi:10.1101/231217) simple sample scoring method for gene-set enrichment analysis**

    A package of functions that can be used to implement singscore.

    Future features will include interactivity in plots and plotting of a
    landscape of scores.

**Author:** Kristy Horan

**Brief Description:** This collection of methods will take a gene set or signature and a single sample (although multiple samples are also acceptable) and return a score reflective of the gene-set or signature enrichment for that single sample.

An example workflow can be seen on the `singscore wiki <https://github
