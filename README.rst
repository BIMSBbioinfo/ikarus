Ikarus
========

Ikarus is a stepwise machine learning pipeline that tries to cope with a task of distinguishing tumor cells from normal cells.
Leveraging multiple annotated single cell datasets it can be used to define a gene set specific to tumor cells. 
First, the latter gene set is used to rank cells and then to train a logistic classifier for the robust classification of tumor and normal cells.
Finally, sensitivity is increased by propagating the cell labels based on a custom cell-cell network. 
Ikarus is tested on multiple single cell datasets to ascertain that it achieves high sensitivity and specificity in multiple experimental contexts.

Installation
============
Ikarus currently supports :code:`python 3.8`, and can be installed from PyPI:

::

  pip install ikarus
 
Alterantively, one can install ikarus' master branch directly from github:
 
::

  python -m pip install git+https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/ikarus.git
  

Usage
=============
The easiest option to get started is to use the provided Tumor/Normal gene lists and the pretrained model:

::

  from ikarus import classifier
  
  model = classifier.Ikarus(signatures_gmt=signatures_path)
  model.load_core_model(model_path)
  predictions = model.predict(test_adata, 'test_name')
  
 
More information on how to train a model or how to create own gene lists is provided in the tutorial notebook.
